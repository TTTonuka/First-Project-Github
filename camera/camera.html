<p>Though there are many types of cameras, all include five indispensable components: <br> (1) the camera box, which holds and protects the sensitive film from all light except that entering through the lens; <br> (2) film, on which the image is recorded, a light-sensitive strip usually wound on a spool, either manually or automatically, as successive pictures are taken; <br> (3) the light control, consisting of an aperture or diaphragm and a shutter, both often adjustable; <br> (4) the lens, which focuses the light rays from the subject onto the film, creating the image, and which is usually adjustable by moving forward or back, changing the focus; <br> (5) the viewing system, which may be separate from the lens system (usually above it) or may operate through it by means of a mirror.<br><br>The earliest camera was the camera obscura, which was adapted to making a permanent image by Joseph Nicéphore Niepce and Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre of France in the 1820s and 1830s. Many improvements followed in the 19th century, notably flexible film, developed and printed outside the camera. In the 20th century a variety of cameras was developed for many different purposes, including aerial photography, document copying, and scientific research.</p>
